# My Portfolio

First website to learn HTML and CSS basics. Static web with pure HTML/CSS (no compilation of preprocessors etc.).

Based on [graphic proposal on Moqups.com](https://app.moqups.com/Jana-V/0umitZwyaA/view/page/aa9df7b72)

## Processing the form

The form is process by primitive PHP script bluntly outputting sent data. For making it work, be sure you are running your local PHP server. Otherwise the PHP code wonâ€™t be run, just printed out as plain text in your browser (or offered to download).
